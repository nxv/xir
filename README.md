# Xir.js

Xir is a flexible web framework which provides easy-to-use, straight-
forward, and powerful server structures to manage all your codes and
resources.

Xir implements an extendible compiler system. You can write everything
in other languages like CoffeeScript instead JavaScript, LESS instead
CSS, and Jade instead HTML. The system will compile all your source
code instantly or dynamically, and manage the cache as well.
